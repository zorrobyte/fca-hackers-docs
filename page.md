# Random Notes \[ToDo]

Yeah only can 3 and EPS needs to go to the new star board, can 1 goes from the WP to the Pacifica star board. The ACC and can 2 would be for op long, which isn't used currently on the xps\_long fork. Check the images pinned in this channel, it should show the layout for both options pretty clearly\
\
Looks pretty up to date to me. The only difference would be the fork for the Comma device, which is xps\_pac currently (regarding initial pass of WP Guide)\
